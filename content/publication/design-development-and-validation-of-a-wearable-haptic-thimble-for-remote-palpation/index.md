publication: Design, Development, and Validation of a Wearable Haptic Thimble
  for Remote Palpation
abstract: During the last years, the need for telemedicine to face the challenge
  of health-care delivery in critical situations, as for example outbreaks of
  pandemic diseases, has acquired increasing importance. Despite that, there is
  no established technology to allow remote palpation in unstructured
  environments. Only few frameworks are available in literature, and the latters
  allow to perform skin indentation by sensing the contact force at a single
  contact point. In this thesis, a novel haptic device has been designed and
  tested by extending a former framework developed by the Siena Robotics and
  Systems Laboratory (SirsLab, UniSi). In the just mentioned framework a patient
  wears on his own finger a sensing device, in order to perform the palpation
  task himself, while at the same time a doctor wears a feedback device, able to
  replicate the pressure exerted by the patient on his own skin. The new
  developed device consists of a silicone haptic thimble holding four small
  form-factor force sensors, in this way the force exerted by the patient during
  the palpation task distributes on four different contact points represented by
  the sensing parts of the sensors. Thanks to this, the doctor is able to better
  understand how the patient's finger pressure distributes on the touched skin.
  Since the framework is based on a doctor that guides the patient through vocal
  instructions, a new video-call communication system has been developed by
  using multi-thread programming and TCP/IP sockets, able to manage both
  audio-video information and tactile information related to the telepalpation
  system.
