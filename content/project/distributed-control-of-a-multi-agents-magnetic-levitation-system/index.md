In this project, we study a CPS made up of 7 magnetic levitation (maglev) systems. The aim of the project is to design a distributed control protocol such that the multi-agents system perform the cooperative tracking problem, both using a distributed regulator based on a distributed neighborhood observer structure, and a distributed regulator based on local observers.
